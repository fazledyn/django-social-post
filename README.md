# django-social-post

## First project with Django. 

I gotta admit, Django is really powerful and handy when it comes to building web apps within a short period of time.
But I gotta also thank Flask for giving me the basic knowledge of how-a-web-app-works in the most simple way possible.

If anyone's out there starting with Django, be sure to learn Flask. 
That would be my advice.
