                These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the access or use by you, an individual, from within any country in
                the world (excluding Israel) of applications, websites, content, products, and services (the “Services”) made available by <b>Cycloan™</b>, a
                private limited liability company established in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

                <br><br>

                Contractual Relationship
            </h2>
            <p>

                Your access and use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which
                establishes a contractual relationship between you and Cycloan. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may
                not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with
                you. Cycloan may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease
                offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.

                Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or
                promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable
                Services. Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the
                purposes of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a
                conflict with respect to the applicable Services.

                Cycloan may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon
                Cycloan’s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on
                the applicable Service. Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your
                consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.

                Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the Services is as provided in Cycloan’s
                Privacy Policy located at https://www.Cycloan.com/privacy/notice. Cycloan may provide to a claims processor or
                an insurer any necessary information (including your contact information) if there is a complaint,
                dispute or conflict, which may include an accident, involving you and a Third Party Provider (including
                a transportation network company driver) and such information or data is necessary to resolve the
                complaint, dispute or conflict.

                The Services
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third party services and content
                (including advertising) that Cycloan does not control. You acknowledge that different terms of use and
                privacy policies may apply to your use of such third party services and content. Cycloan does not endorse
                such third party services and content and in no event shall Cycloan be responsible or liable for any
                products or services of such third party providers. Additionally, Apple Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft
                Corporation or BlackBerry Limited and/or their applicable international subsidiaries and affiliates will
                be third-party beneficiaries to this contract if you access the Services using Applications developed
                for Apple iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, or Blackberry-powered mobile devices, respectively. These
                third party beneficiaries are not parties to this contract and are not responsible for the provision or
                support of the Services in any manner. Your access to the Services using these devices is subject to

                Governing Law & Arbitration
            </h2>
            <p>
                Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, these Terms shall be exclusively governed by and construed
                in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands, excluding its rules on conflicts of laws. The Vienna
                Convention on the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG) shall not apply. Any dispute, conflict,
                claim or controversy arising out of or broadly in connection with or relating to the Services or these
                Terms, including those relating to its validity, its construction or its enforceability (any “Dispute”)
                shall be first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of
                Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been settled within sixty (60)
                days after a request for mediation has been submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can
                be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of
                Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules' Emergency
                Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed
                in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and arbitration shall be Amsterdam, The
                Netherlands, without prejudice to any rights you may have under Article 18 of the Brussels I bis
                Regulation (OJ EU 2012 L351/1) and/or Article 6:236n of the Dutch Civil Code. The language of the
                mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not spe­ak English, in which case the
                mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language. The existence
                and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by
                the parties, correspondence from and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the
                mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly
                confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the
                other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of
                conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in
                writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.
